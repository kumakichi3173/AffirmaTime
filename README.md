AffirmaTime is a self-care and affirmation web app built with Retool and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. It helps users unload stress through a 10-minute guided session, provides logical solutions, and allows them to log their emotional status through daily ratings and a calendar view. The app blends Retool’s custom components, timers, and GPT prompts to encourage emotional awareness and positive reflection.

## Overview

The app begins with a **10-minute timer** during which users are invited to freely type their thoughts, stressors, or feelings into a ChatGPT-powered input area. Once the timer expires, users need to stop overthinking, reframe their mindset, and carry positive energy into the rest of the day. This time-boxed method ensures users can express what’s weighing on them, receive advice, and move on with clarity and confidence, without spiraling into negativity.

## Key Features

-  10-minute timer for structured emotional unloading  
-  Daily rating and reflection log, with the ability to export/download data on the final page
-  Calendar view to track emotional trends over time
-  ChatGPT provides short-term and long-term solutions for your concerns

## Philosophy

This app helps users intentionally release stress and stop dwelling on the past after the timer has expired.

## Requirements

- OpenAI API Key (GPT-3.5 Turbo)  
- Retool account (free tier supported)
