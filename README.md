# AffirmaTime – 10-Minute Daily Reset App (Retool + ChatGPT)

AffirmaTime is a self-care and affirmation web app built with Retool and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. It helps users unload stress through a 10-minute guided session, receive supportive affirmations, and log their emotional status through daily ratings and a calendar view. The app blends Retool’s custom components, built-in Chat UI, timers, and GPT prompts to encourage emotional awareness and positive reflection.

## Overview

The app begins with a **10-minute timer** during which users are invited to freely type their thoughts, stressors, or feelings into a ChatGPT-powered input area.

During this period, **ChatGPT responds empathetically** — validating emotions and offering helpful, logical insights tailored to the user’s situation. This phase is designed to allow users to offload mental clutter without judgment.

Once the timer expires, the assistant **gently transitions into “affirmation mode.”**  
From that point on, ChatGPT focuses solely on supportive, forward-looking messages — encouraging users to stop overthinking, reframe their mindset, and carry positive energy into the rest of the day.

This time-boxed method ensures users can express what’s weighing on them, receive comfort and advice, and move on with clarity and confidence — without spiraling into negativity.
